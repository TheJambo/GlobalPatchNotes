Our goal is to present major policy changes with out any kind of partisan spin, only the facts.

----------

### Format Guide

#### Changes
Although we do not offer our opinions on changes there are some cases where there is a clear upgrade or downgrade over the status quo, we will use colors to indicate this.

 - Bad <span style="color:green">⇒</span> Good
 - Good <span style="color:red">⇒</span> Bad
 - Old <span style="color:blue">⇒</span> New *(Up to the reader to decide)*


#### Removal
Similarly to changes removal uses the three color system, the word Removal will also be colored to draw attention to these major changes of status quo.

 - Bad <span style="color:green">⇒ Removed</span>
 - Good <span style="color:red">⇒ Removed</span>
 - Old <span style="color:blue">⇒ Removed</span> *(Up to the reader to decide)*


#### Additions
Same as the previous two items, although with new policy the impact can often be more difficult to determine so you may see many of these in blue.

 - <span style="color:green">*NEW:*</span> Good
 - <span style="color:red">*NEW:*</span> Bad
 - <span style="color:blue">*NEW:*</span> Up to the reader to decide
